# Mesopotamian Brick Orthophotos and Editions 
Stitches of images and text editions--transliteration, translation and additional commentary--of 40 baked bricks studied in the article "Exploring geomagnetic variations in ancient Mesopotamia: Archaeomagnetic study of inscribed bricks from the 3^rd^–1^st^ millennia BCE". We correlated the magnetic orientations of bricks of well-known kings in a relative chronology with previous studies from the Levant, Syria, Turkey, and the Diyala region. Historical inscriptions have always been instrumental in archaeological research to synchronize important events, like campaigns, the construction of monumental buildings, or the length of a king’s reign. But there are very few scientific methods that can help us corroborate the absolute date of an inscription, let alone one that can be independently judged against the possible dates of other dated inscriptions.
